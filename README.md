<!-- vale on -->

A reusable GitHub Action that runs as a required workflow check. It generates a signed request using HMAC-SHA256 and calls the Dependabot Policy Enforcer API to validate that a repository meets Dependabot policy requirements.

This action:

1. Reads the repository shared secret from a repository secret (`DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET`)
2. Generates an HMAC-SHA256 signature from the repository name and a UTC timestamp
3. Sends a signed `POST` request to the configured policy enforcer API endpoint
4. Fails the check with a clear message if the policy is not met, the secret is missing, or configuration is malformed

## Setup

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dependabot-policy-enforcer-action.git
cd nhs-england-tools/dependabot-policy-enforcer-action
```

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or later,
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 4.x — enable via `corepack enable`.

### Configuration

Install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

Each repository that uses this action also needs a shared secret registered with the Dependabot Policy Enforcer service. Contact your platform team to have a secret provisioned, then store it as a repository secret:

1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** in your repository.
2. Click **New repository secret**.
3. Name: `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET`
4. Value: the secret provided by your platform team.

To avoid hardcoding environment-specific values, use the following storage approach:

| Value | Recommended storage |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| API endpoint URL | Organisation variable: `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_API_ENDPOINT` |
| Shared HMAC secret | Repository secret: `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET` |

Organisation variables are accessible to all repositories in the organisation without duplication.

## Usage

Add the following workflow file to your repository at `.github/workflows/dependabot-policy-check.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Dependabot Policy Check

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  dependabot-policy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nhs-england-tools/dependabot-policy-enforcer-action@v1
        with:
          api-endpoint: ${{ vars.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_API_ENDPOINT }}
          secret: ${{ secrets.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET }}
          mode: ${{ vars.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_MODE }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `permissions: pull-requests: write` block is required for the action to post PR comments. If you do not need PR comments, omit the `github-token` input and the permissions block.

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `api-endpoint` | Yes | — | Full URL of the Dependabot Policy Enforcer API endpoint. Set this as an organisation or repository variable (`vars.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_API_ENDPOINT`). |
| `secret` | Yes | — | Shared HMAC secret for this repository. Must be stored as a repository secret (`secrets.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET`). **Never hardcode this value.** |
| `mode` | No | `enforce` | Policy mode: `enforce` (fail workflow on policy violation) or `report` (log warnings but do not fail). |
| `timeout-ms` | No | `10000` | Request timeout in milliseconds. |
| `github-token` | No | — | GitHub token used to post a policy summary comment on the pull request. Use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. If omitted, no PR comment is posted. Also required for the [dependency update exemption](#dependency-update-exemption). |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `status-code` | The HTTP status code returned by the API. |
| `response-body` | The response body from the API (sensitive fields are redacted). |

### Modes

The `mode` input controls how the action responds to policy violations:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| ---- | --------- |
| `enforce` | Fails the workflow check when the repository does not meet the Dependabot policy. This is the default. |
| `report` | Logs the policy result as a warning but always passes the workflow check. Use this during initial rollout to observe results without blocking merges. |

Set the mode centrally via an organisation variable (`DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_MODE`) so that all repositories share the same default. Individual repositories can override it with a repository-level variable of the same name.

### PR comments

When the `github-token` input is provided and the workflow is triggered by a `pull_request` event, the action posts (or updates) a summary comment on the PR.

The comment includes:

- **Status** — ✅ Passed, ❌ Failed, or ⚠️ Exempted
- **Mode** — the active mode for this run
- **Summary** — severity counts from the policy check
- **Violations** — number of findings per category
- **Link** — direct link to the repository's Dependabot alerts page

The comment is idempotent: subsequent runs update the same comment rather than creating duplicates. Comment failures are logged as warnings and never mask the policy decision.

### Dependency update exemption

In `enforce` mode, PRs that modify dependency management or GitHub Actions files are automatically exempted from policy failure. This allows PRs that are actively fixing vulnerabilities to proceed without being blocked by the very alerts they are resolving.

Exempted file types include:

- Package manager files — `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, and others
- Lock files — `package-lock.json`, `Gemfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, etc.
- Python requirements files matching `requirements*.txt`
- .NET project files (`*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `*.vbproj`) and Ruby gemspecs (`*.gemspec`)
- GitHub Actions definitions under `.github/workflows/` and `.github/actions/`

The exemption requires the `github-token` input to fetch the PR file list from the GitHub API. If the token is absent, the PR number cannot be determined, or the API call fails, the original policy result is preserved (fail-safe).

Exempted PRs show a status of ⚠️ **Exempted — dependency update detected** in the PR comment and workflow logs.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```shell
yarn test --typecheck --run
```

Run with coverage:

```shell
yarn test --typecheck --run --coverage
```

A helper script is included at `scripts/hmac-helper.ts` to assist with local testing and signature verification. The core functions (`hmacHex`, `generateSignature`, `verifySignature`) are the reference implementation of the signing algorithm, providing a vetted starting point and enabling debugging of signature failures before raising a pull request:

```shell
# Generate headers for a test request
yarn hmac-helper generate \
  --repo my-org/my-repo \
  --secret <your-secret>

# Verify an existing signature
yarn hmac-helper verify \
  --repo my-org/my-repo \
  --secret <your-secret> \
  --timestamp 2026-03-03T12:00:00.000Z \
  --signature sha256=<hex>

# Send a real request (for integration testing in dev)
yarn hmac-helper request \
  --repo my-org/my-repo \
  --secret <your-secret> \
  --endpoint $DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_API_ENDPOINT
```

## Design

### Diagrams

Each request is signed using HMAC-SHA256. The signing payload combines the repository name and a UTC timestamp, which is verified server-side against the stored secret. The timestamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format with milliseconds zeroed (`.000Z` suffix), and the hex digest is prefixed with `sha256=`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Action->>+Action: Read DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET
    Action->>Action: Generate UTC timestamp
    Action->>Action: HMAC-SHA256(secret, "repo:timestamp")
    Action->>+API: POST /check<br/>X-Hub-Repository, X-Hub-Timestamp, X-Hub-Signature-256
    API->>API: Validate timestamp window
    API->>API: Verify HMAC signature
    API->>API: Check repository policy
    API-->>-Action: 200 OK / 4xx policy violation
    Action-->>-Runner: Pass / Fail check
```

Every request includes the following signed headers:

| Header | Example value | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| `X-Hub-Repository` | `my-org/my-repo` | The full repository name in `owner/repo` format. Derived automatically from `github.repository`. |
| `X-Hub-Timestamp` | `2026-03-03T12:00:00.000Z` | UTC timestamp used in signature generation. |
| `X-Hub-Signature-256` | `sha256=a1b2c3...` | HMAC-SHA256 hex digest, prefixed with `sha256=`. |

### Modularity

The action is configurable via inputs (see [Inputs](#inputs)) and enforces the following authentication rules server-side. The action will fail with a descriptive message if any check does not pass:

| Rule | Window / Constraint | Error if violated |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Timestamp must be valid ISO 8601 UTC | — | `INVALID_TIMESTAMP` |
| Timestamp must not be older than 5 minutes | 300 000 ms | `TIMESTAMP_EXPIRED` |
| Timestamp must not be more than 30 seconds in the future | 30 000 ms | `TIMESTAMP_FUTURE` |
| Repository organisation must be in the allowlist | — | `FORBIDDEN_REPO` |
| HMAC signature must match | — | `SIGNATURE_MISMATCH` |
| Repository secret must exist | — | `SECRET_NOT_FOUND` |

Error handling behaviour:

| Scenario | Behaviour |
| -------- | --------- |
| `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET` is missing or empty | Action fails immediately with a clear error message before any network call is made. |
| `api-endpoint` is missing or malformed | Action fails immediately with a clear error message. |
| Non-2xx response from API | Action fails and logs the status code and (redacted) response body. The secret is never included in logs. |
| Request timeout | Action fails with a timeout error after the configured `timeout-ms`. |
| `TIMESTAMP_EXPIRED` | Indicates the runner clock is significantly behind. Check runner time synchronisation. |

Security considerations:

- The shared secret is **never** written to logs, workflow summaries, or outputs.
- The action uses `core.setSecret()` to mask the secret value in all log output.
- Replay attacks are prevented by the 5-minute timestamp window enforced by the authoriser.
- The repository name is validated against an organisation allowlist server-side.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| `secret input is required` | `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET` is not set or not passed to the action. | Add the secret in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and reference it as `secrets.DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_SECRET` in the workflow. |
| `api-endpoint input is required` | `DEPENDABOT_ENFORCER_API_ENDPOINT` variable is missing. | Set it as an organisation or repository variable. |
| `TIMESTAMP_EXPIRED` | The runner clock is more than 5 minutes behind UTC. | Check the runner's time synchronisation. Self-hosted runners may need NTP configured. |
| `SIGNATURE_MISMATCH` | The secret stored in GitHub does not match the secret registered in the backend DynamoDB table. | Verify the secret value matches on both sides. Use `yarn hmac-helper verify` locally to debug. |
| `FORBIDDEN_REPO` | The repository's organisation is not in the backend allowlist. | Contact the platform team to add your organisation. |
| `SECRET_NOT_FOUND` | The backend has no secret entry for this repository. | Contact the platform team to provision a secret for your repository. |
| PR comment not appearing | `github-token` input is missing, or the workflow lacks `pull-requests: write` permission. | Add `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` and the `permissions` block shown in the [Usage](#usage) example. |
| Dependency exemption not working | `github-token` is missing, the event is not a `pull_request`, or the PR file list API call failed. | Check the workflow logs for warnings. Ensure the token is provided and the event trigger is `pull_request`. |
